a simple detect face


Install package cv2 and face_recognition by 2 comment : pip install opencv-python and pip install face_recognition

If install face_recognition is error due to dlin, try this comment : python -m pip install dlib-19.22.99-cp39-cp39m-win_amd64.whl. It then appear notification about missing dlin file in somewhere. Copy the dlib file i attach in this repo and paste to that location. Run again.

Run main.py
